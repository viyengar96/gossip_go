Lab 4: Gossip Membership Heartbeat Protocol in Go

Usage: ./gossip_go X Y Z

Sample Run:
go build gossip
./gossip_go 10 100 1000

n, m, and i are positive integers
X: time period (s) to increase the heartbeat counter
Y: time period (s) to send heartbeat tables to neighbors
Z: time period (s) to simulate one node failing and print current tables 

What we tested with:
Each letter should be at least a factor of 10 greater than the letter preceding it (X=X <= Y=10X <= Z=100X)
Example usage: ./gossip_go 10 100 1000
